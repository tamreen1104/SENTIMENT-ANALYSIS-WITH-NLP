# Description

The core objective of this task is to:

Understand and apply the steps involved in text data preprocessing.

Convert text data into numerical form that can be fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment expressed in a given review.

Evaluate the model’s performance using suitable metrics.

Sentiment analysis is an essential task in NLP that helps businesses and researchers understand customer opinions, brand perception, and feedback from large volumes of text data.

Instructions
Dataset selection: You should choose a dataset containing customer reviews. This could be any freely available dataset such as Amazon reviews, IMDB movie reviews, Twitter comments, or product reviews from Kaggle.

Preprocessing: The text data must be cleaned and prepared for modeling. This typically involves:

Converting all text to lowercase.

Removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers.

Tokenizing text (splitting into individual words).

Removing stop words (common words like “and,” “the,” “is” that may not contribute to sentiment).

Optionally, applying stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

Feature extraction: You will use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert the processed text into a numerical matrix where each value represents the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire dataset. TF-IDF helps in emphasizing more meaningful words and reducing the weight of common, less informative words.

Modeling: Using Scikit-learn’s Logistic Regression, you will train a classification model. Logistic regression is well-suited for binary classification tasks like positive vs. negative sentiment detection.

Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80%-20% split) and evaluate your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess how well your model distinguishes between classes.

Deliverable
You must submit a Jupyter Notebook that contains:

The data preprocessing steps (with clear code and comments).

TF-IDF vectorization implementation.

Logistic regression model training.

Evaluation metrics and discussion of results.

Visualizations such as a confusion matrix plot or bar charts of class distribution (optional but encouraged).
